# Sundial (vscode-sundial)

Sundial changes your theme based on your day and night cycle. It is inspired by the OSX Mojave dynamic backgrounds and should reduce eye pain when working in the night or on the day. Humans should not strain their eyes too much, it's not recommended to have a light theme in the night and vice versa.

Whenever you have ideas for this project, things you would like to add or you found a bug, feel free to create an issue or start contributing.
