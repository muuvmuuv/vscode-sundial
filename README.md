# Sundial (vscode-sundial)

Sundial changes your theme based on day and night ranges. It is inspired by the OSX Mojave dynamic backgrounds and should reduce eye pain when working in the night or on the day. Humans should not strain their eyes too much, it's not recommended to have a light theme in the night and vice versa.
