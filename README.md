Sundial changes your theme and VS Code settings (if needed) based on your day and night
cycle or other options, you choose. It is inspired by the
[OSX Mojave dynamic backgrounds](https://www.apple.com/de/macos/mojave/) and
[Night Owl for Mac](https://nightowl.kramser.xyz/). It should _reduce eye pain_ when
working in the night or on the day. Humans should not strain their eyes too much, it's
**not recommended** to have a light theme in the night and vice versa.

Whenever you have ideas for this project, things you would like to add or you found a bug,
feel free to create an issue or start contributing! üòá

> The minimum supported VS Code version is
> [1.74.3](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/1.74.3)

> still when VS Code triggers some editor events.

> Any changes to sundial or VS Code settings will re-enable Sundial.

> On both `daySettings` and `nightSettings` they will override your Workbench VSCode
> settings. Please make sure both have the same properties otherwise they will not change
> since Sundial is not remembering the settings you have set before!

#### Automatically set by current location

Sundial will fetch your geolocation from [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/).

| Setting              | Default | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sundial.autoLocale` | _false_ | Updates your location based on your geolocation. |

#### Automatically set by latitude and longitude

You can get your geolocation from [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/) or any other map service.

| Setting             | Default | Description        |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| `sundial.latitude`  | _‚äò_     | e.g. _"50.110924"_ |
| `sundial.longitude` | _‚äò_     | e.g. _"8.682127"_  |

#### Automatically set by OS appearance

Since VS Code version 1.42.0 it is now build in so you don't need this extension for this
options.

```json
{
  "window.autoDetectColorScheme": true
}
```

Read more about the implementation here:

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/61519
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/86600
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/87405

### VS Code Settings

You can change your VS Code settings depending on your circle, this comes pretty handy if
you have issues ready a font size of 12 in the night.

```jsonc
{
  "sundial.daySettings": {
    "editor.fontSize": 12
  },
  "sundial.nightSettings": {
    "editor.fontSize": 14
  }
}
```

### Execution order

Sundial will check your settings in the following order and if one setting is present the
next coming will be ignored.

1. `sundial.latitude` and `sundial.longitude`
2. `sundial.autoLocale`
3. `sundial.sunrise` and `sundial.sunset`

### Status bar icon

![Status bar icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muuvmuuv/vscode-sundial/main/assets/status-bar-icon.png)

Sundial will show a status bar icon that will toggle the current theme on click. This will
also disable all sundial automated checks.

### Examples

```jsonc
{
  "window.autoDetectColorScheme": false, // required!
  "workbench.preferredLightColorTheme": "Default Light+",
  "workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme": "Default Dark+",
  "sundial.interval": 20,
  "sundial.autoLocale": true
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "window.autoDetectColorScheme": false, // required!
  "workbench.preferredLightColorTheme": "Default Light+",
  "workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme": "Default Dark+",
  "sundial.sunrise": "05:12"
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "window.autoDetectColorScheme": false, // required!
  "workbench.preferredLightColorTheme": "Default Light+",
  "workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme": "Default Dark+",
  "sundial.dayVariable": 43,
  "sundial.latitude": "50.110924",
  "sundial.longitude": "8.682127",
  "sundial.daySettings": {
    "editor.fontSize": 13
  },
  "sundial.nightSettings": {
    "editor.fontSize": 15
  }
}
```

## Development

I am working with [**esbuild**](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle Sundial to the
smallest possible size to increase the load time in VS Code _for you_.

> The minimum supported VS Code version is
> [1.74.3](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/1.74.3)

1.  Install packages via npm: `npm run install` (_pnpm_ does not work due to
    [this VSCE Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/421))
2.  Run debugger => `Launch Extension`
    - View the _Extension Host_ and adjust settings to test **or**
    - Change a file and save it, let it compile
3.  Commit your changes with a detailed explanation
4.  Create a pull request

> Package size: 279.8kb

### Deployment

We use `release-it` to create a new release. This will automatically create a tag, release
and new changelog for us.

```
pnpm release-it --help
```

Sundial is deployed on VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX.

- VS Code Marketplace:
  - `vsce publish`
- Open VSX:
  - `vsce package`
  - `npx ovsx publish *.vsix -p TOKEN`

#### Pre-release

We update our version with release-it, so we must use some additional flags for `vsce`.
The version must be without pre-release identifier, because VS Code Marketplace does not
allow those.

```
pnpm vsce publish --pre-release --no-git-tag-version --no-update-package-json <pre_release_version>
```

### Commits

Sundial follows the `config-conventional` spec.
